## Option 3: Problem-Solution Focused
```
Indie hackers waste too much time on:
❌ Building ideas nobody wants
❌ Getting polite feedback that doesn't help
❌ Not tracking progress consistently
❌ Not learning from real revenue data

Built 5 tools to fix this:

1. Brutal Feedback Exchange
2. Ship It or Kill It
3. Public Building Tracker
4. Revenue Transparency Hub
5. Copy the Playbook

Open source. Built for the community.

@levelsio would love your thoughts 💭

## Option 5: Story-Driven
```
After building solo for years, I noticed indie hackers need:

1. Honest feedback (not polite BS)
2. Idea validation (before wasting time)
3. Progress tracking (to stay accountable)
4. Real revenue data (not vanity metrics)
5. Learn from success (step-by-step playbooks)

So I built 5 tools to solve this. Open source. Free forever.

@levelsio your transparency inspired this 🚀
